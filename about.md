Hi, I'm Archit. I am a web developer trying to make products that solve problems I see around me in my day-to-day life. I work at a web studio called [Miranj](https://miranj.in) in New Delhi, India. This website is an exercise in narcissism where I try to pretend that my learnings are important enough to be shared with other people.
